                Hey there! My name is Khalil Khalil. I'm an aspiring developer wether that means
                full stack, front end, or back end. I want to grow, learn, and improve as much
                as I can in development and I'm looking for a company that encourages and nutures that growth.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I am currently attending the Case Western Reserve University coding boot camp learning
                as much as I can. All the work and projects I've done so far are available for you to
                for you to check out. I look forward to meeting and working with you soon!
